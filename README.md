   ```env
   API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the Flask server**

## 🔧 Configuration

### API Integration
The application uses OpenRouter API with Mistral AI model. You'll need to:
1. Sign up at [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/)
2. Get your API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file

## 🌐 Deployment

The application is deployed on Render with automatic deployments from the main branch.

### Environment Variables (Production)
- Ensure to create and generate your own keys

## 🎯 How It Works

1. **Session Management**: Each user gets a unique session ID for tracking conversations
2. **Context Preservation**: All messages are stored in context history that persists across character switches
3. **Character Switching**: When switching characters, the AI receives system instructions about the change while maintaining conversation memory
4. **Smart Context Limiting**: Conversations are limited to the last 30 exchanges to prevent token limit issue
