## üéØ How It Works

1. **Session Management**: Each user gets a unique session ID for tracking conversations
2. **Context Preservation**: All messages are stored in context history that persists across character switches
3. **Character Switching**: When switching characters, the AI receives system instructions about the change while maintaining conversation memory
4. **Smart Context Limiting**: Conversations are limited to the last 30 exchanges to prevent token limit issue
