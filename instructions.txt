 AI Chatbot Project Setup Guide
===============================

Welcome to your AI Chatbot project! This guide will help you set up your environment and get started.

-------------------------------
 Project Structure
-------------------------------

Your project is organized as follows:

  client/      - Client-side interface code for your chatbot
  ai.py        - Core AI logic implementation
  server.py    - Server-side code to handle requests and interact with the AI
  .env         - Stores environment variables (including your API key)

-------------------------------
 Getting Started
-------------------------------

1. Create a Virtual Environment
   It's recommended to use a virtual environment for managing dependencies.
   Open your terminal in the project root and run:

     python -m venv venv

2. Activate Your Virtual Environment

   On Windows:
     .\venv\Scripts\activate

   On macOS/Linux:
     source venv/bin/activate

3. Install Required Packages
   With your virtual environment activated, install dependencies:

     pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Obtain an API Key from OpenRouter

   - Visit https://openrouter.ai/
   - Sign up or log in
   - Go to your API Keys section (in account settings or dashboard)
   - Generate a new API key

5. Configure Your API Key in .env

   Open the .env file in your project root and add:

     API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

   (Replace YOUR_API_KEY_HERE with your actual key.)

   For development, you can use any of the freely available models from OpenRouter.
